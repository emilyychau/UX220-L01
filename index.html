#A Favourite Thing I Wrote
##An Essay on Memory
Hi there! My name is Emily Chau. One of my favourite things that I wrote was a paper for a high school Psychology class. It was titled "False and erroneous memories: Misinformation and its effect on memory and human behaviour". For me, it was a great introduction and exercise in reading and analyzing academic literature.

I had a great time researching and writing that essay, and the positive feedback that I received helped to reassure me to study some psychology at the university level. Flash forward to the present, I am now a second year UX Design student with minors in Psychology and Physical Forensics.
